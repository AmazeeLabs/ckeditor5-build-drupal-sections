Because of it, we need to fill all\n * empty elements which should be selectable with elements or characters called \"fillers\". Unfortunately there is no one\n * universal filler, this is why two types are uses:\n *\n * * Block filler is an element which fill block elements, like `<p>`. CKEditor uses `<br>` as a block filler during the editing,\n * as browsers do natively. So instead of an empty `<p>` there will be `<p><br></p>`. The advantage of block filler is that\n * it is transparent for the selection, so when the caret is before the `<br>` and user presses right arrow he will be\n * moved to the next paragraph, not after the `<br>`. The disadvantage is that it breaks a block, so it can not be used\n * in the middle of a line of text. The {@link module:engine/view/filler~BR_FILLER `<br>` filler} can be replaced with any other\n * character in the data output, for instance {@link module:engine/view/filler~NBSP_FILLER non-breaking space}.\n *\n * * Inline filler is a filler which does not break a line of text, so it can be used inside the text, for instance in the empty\n * `<b>` surrendered by text: `foo<b></b>bar`, if we want to put the caret there. CKEditor uses a sequence of the zero-width\n * spaces as an {@link module:engine/view/filler~INLINE_FILLER inline filler} having the predetermined\n * {@link module:engine/view/filler~INLINE_FILLER_LENGTH length}. A sequence is used, instead of a single character to\n * avoid treating random zero-width spaces as the inline filler. Disadvantage of the inline filler is that it is not\n * transparent for the selection. The arrow key moves the caret between zero-width spaces characters, so the additional\n * code is needed to handle the caret.\n *\n * Both inline and block fillers are handled by the {@link module:engine/view/renderer~Renderer renderer} and are not present in the\n * view.\n *\n * @module engine/view/filler\n */\n\n/**\n * `<br>` filler creator.

Callbacks listening to those events are called converters. Those\n * converters role is to convert the model changes to changes in view (for example, adding view nodes or\n * changing attributes on view elements).\n *\n * During conversion process, `DowncastDispatcher` fires events, basing on state of the model and prepares\n * data for those events. It is important to understand that those events are connected with changes done on model,\n * for example: \"node has been inserted\" or \"attribute has changed\". This is in a contrary to upcasting (view to model conversion),\n * where we convert view state (view nodes) to a model tree.\n *\n * The events are prepared basing on a diff created by {@link module:engine/model/differ~Differ Differ}, which buffers them\n * and then passes to `DowncastDispatcher` as a diff between old model state and new model state.\n *\n * Note, that because changes are converted there is a need to have a mapping between model structure and view structure.\n * To map positions and elements during downcast (model to view conversion) use {@link module:engine/conversion/mapper~Mapper}.\n *\n * `DowncastDispatcher` fires following events for model tree changes:\n *\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:insert insert}\n * if a range of nodes has been inserted to the model tree,\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:remove remove}\n * if a range of nodes has been removed from the model tree,\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:attribute attribute}\n * if attribute has been added, changed or removed from a model node.\n *\n * For {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:insert insert}\n * and {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:attribute attribute},\n * `DowncastDispatcher` generates {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconsumable~ModelConsumable consumables}.\n * These are used to have a control over which changes has been already consumed. It is useful when some converters\n * overwrite other or converts multiple changes (for example converts insertion of an element and also converts that\n * element's attributes during insertion).\n *\n * Additionally, `DowncastDispatcher` fires events for {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~Marker marker} changes:\n *\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:addMarker} if a marker has been added,\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:removeMarker} if a marker has been removed.\n *\n * Note, that changing a marker is done through removing the marker from the old range, and adding on the new range,\n * so both those events are fired.\n *\n * Finally, `DowncastDispatcher` also handles firing events for {@link module:engine/model/selection model selection}\n * conversion:\n *\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:selection}\n * which converts selection from model to view,\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:attribute}\n * which is fired for every selection attribute,\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:addMarker}\n * which is fired for every marker which contains selection.\n *\n * Unlike model tree and markers, events for selection are not fired for changes but for selection state.\n *\n * When providing custom listeners for `DowncastDispatcher` remember to check whether given change has not been\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconsumable~ModelConsumable#consume consumed} yet.\n *\n * When providing custom listeners for `DowncastDispatcher` keep in mind that any callback that had\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconsumable~ModelConsumable#consume consumed} a value from a consumable and\n * converted the change should also stop the event (for efficiency purposes).\n *\n * When providing custom listeners for `DowncastDispatcher` remember to use provided\n * {@link module:engine/view/downcastwriter~DowncastWriter view downcast writer} to apply changes to the view document.\n *\n * Example of a custom converter for `DowncastDispatcher`:\n *\n *\t\t// We will convert inserting \"paragraph\" model element into the model.\n *\t\tdowncastDispatcher.on( 'insert:paragraph', ( evt, data, conversionApi ) => {\n *\t\t\t// Remember to check whether the change has not been consumed yet and consume it.\n *\t\t\tif ( conversionApi.consumable.consume( data.item, 'insert' ) ) {\n

Defines allowed attributes of the given item.\n * * `allowContentOf` &ndash; A string or an array of strings.

Inherits attributes from other items.\n * * `inheritTypesFrom` &ndash; A string or an array of strings. Inherits `is*` properties of other items.\n * * `inheritAllFrom` &ndash; A string. A shorthand for `allowContentOf`, `allowWhere`, `allowAttributesOf`, `inheritTypesFrom`.\n * * Additionally, you can define the following `is*` properties: `isBlock`, `isLimit`, `isObject`. Read about them below.\n *\n * # The is* properties\n *\n * There are 3 commonly used `is*` properties. Their role is to assign additional semantics to schema items.\n * You can define more properties but you will also need to implement support for them in the existing editor features.\n *\n * * `isBlock` &ndash; Whether this item is paragraph-like. Generally speaking, content is usually made out of blocks\n * like paragraphs, list items, images, headings, etc. All these elements are marked as blocks. A block\n * should not allow another block inside. Note: There is also the `$block` generic item which has `isBlock` set to `true`.\n * Most block type items will inherit from `$block` (through `inheritAllFrom`).\n * * `isLimit` &ndash; It can be understood as whether this element should not be split by <kbd>Enter</kbd>.\n * Examples of limit elements: `$root`, table cell, image caption, etc. In other words, all actions that happen inside\n * a limit element are limited to its content. **Note:** All objects (`isObject`) are treated as limit elements, too.\n * * `isObject` &ndash; Whether an item is \"self-contained\" and should be treated as a whole. Examples of object elements:\n * `image`, `table`, `video`, etc. **Note:** An object is also a limit, so\n * {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema#isLimit `isLimit()`}\n * returns `true` for object elements automatically.\n *\n * # Generic items\n *\n * There are three basic generic items: `$root`, `$block` and `$text`.\n * They are defined as follows:\n *\n *\t\tthis.schema.register( '$root', {\n *\t\t\tisLimit: true\n *\t\t} );\n *\t\tthis.schema.register( '$block', {\n *\t\t\tallowIn: '$root',\n *\t\t\tisBlock: true\n *\t\t} );\n *\t\tthis.schema.register( '$text', {\n *\t\t\tallowIn: '$block'\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * They reflect typical editor content that is contained within one root, consists of several blocks\n * (paragraphs, lists items, headings, images) which, in turn, may contain text inside.\n *\n * By inheriting from the generic items you can define new items which will get extended by other editor features.\n * Read more about generic types in the {@linkTODO Defining schema} guide.\n *\n * # Example definitions\n *\n * Allow `paragraph` in roots and block quotes:\n *\n *\t\tschema.register( 'paragraph', {\n *\t\t\tallowIn: [ '$root', 'blockQuote' ],\n *\t\t\tisBlock: true\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * Allow `paragraph` everywhere where `$block` is allowed (i.e. in `$root`):\n *\n *\t\tschema.register( 'paragraph', {\n *\t\t\tallowWhere: '$block',\n *\t\t\tisBlock: true\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * Make `image` a block object, which is allowed everywhere where `$block` is.\n * Also, allow `src` and `alt` attributes in it:\n *\n *\t\tschema.register( 'image', {\n *\t\t\tallowWhere: '$block',\n *\t\t\tallowAttributes: [ 'src', 'alt' ],\n *\t\t\tisBlock: true,\n *\t\t\tisObject: true\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * Make `caption` allowed in `image` and make it allow all the content of `$block`s (usually, `$text`).\n * Also, mark it as a limit element so it cannot be split:\n *\n *\t\tschema.register( 'caption', {\n *\t\t\tallowIn: 'image',\n *\t\t\tallowContentOf: '$block',\n *\t\t\tisLimit: true\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * Make `listItem` inherit all from `$block` but also allow additional attributes:\n *\n *\t\tschema.register( 'listItem', {\n *\t\t\tinheritAllFrom: '$block',\n *\t\t\tallowAttributes: [ 'listType', 'listIndent' ]\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * Which translates to:\n *\n *\t\tschema.register( 'listItem', {\n *\t\t\tallowWhere: '$block',\n *\t\t\tallowContentOf: '$block',\n *\t\t\tallowAttributesOf: '$block',\n *\t\t\tinheritTypesFrom: '$block',\n *\t\t\tallowAttributes: [ 'listType', 'listIndent' ]\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * # Tips\n *\n * * Check schema definitions of existing features to see how they are defined.\n * * If you want to publish your feature so other developers can use it, try to use\n * generic items as much as possible.\n * * Keep your model clean. Limit it to the actual data and store information in a normalized way.\n * * Remember about definining the `is*` properties. They do not affect the allowed structures, but they can\n * affect how the editor features treat your elements.\n *\n * @typedef {Object} module:engine/model/schema~SchemaItemDefinition\n */\n\n/**\n * A simplified version of {@link module:engine/model/schema~SchemaItemDefinition} after\n * compilation by the {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema schema}.\n * Rules fed to the schema by {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema#register}\n * and {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema#extend} methods are defined in the\n * {@link module:engine/model/schema~SchemaItemDefinition} format.\n * Later on, they are compiled to `SchemaCompiledItemDefition` so when you use e.g.\n * the {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema#getDefinition} method you get the compiled version.\n *\n * The compiled version contains only the following properties:\n *\n * * The `name` property,\n * * The `is*` properties,\n * * The `allowIn` array,\n * * The `allowAttributes` array.\n *\n * @typedef {Object} module:engine/model/schema~SchemaCompiledItemDefinition\n */\n\n/**\n * A schema context &mdash; a list of ancestors of a given position in the document.\n *\n * Considering such position:\n *\n *\t\t<$root>\n *\t\t\t<blockQuote>\n *\t\t\t\t<paragraph>\n *\t\t\t\t\t^\n *\t\t\t\t</paragraph>\n *\t\t\t</blockQuote>\n *\t\t</$root>\n *\n * The context of this position is its {@link module:engine/model/position~Position#getAncestors lists of ancestors}:\n *\n *\t\t[ rootElement, blockQuoteElement, paragraphElement ]\n *\n * Contexts are used in the {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema#event:checkChild `Schema#checkChild`} and\n * {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema#event:checkAttribute `Schema#checkAttribute`} events as a definition\n * of a place in the document where the check occurs.

In contrary to {@link module:engine/model/node~Node nodes}, which are building blocks of\n * model document tree, markers are not stored directly in document tree but in\n * {@link module:engine/model/model~Model#markers model markers' collection}. Still, they are document data, by giving\n * additional meaning to the part of a model document between marker start and marker end.\n *\n * In this sense, markers are similar to adding and converting attributes on nodes. The difference is that attribute is\n * connected with a given node (e.g. a character is bold no matter if it gets moved or content around it changes).\n * Markers on the other hand are continuous ranges and are characterized by their start and end position. This means that\n * any character in the marker is marked by the marker. For example, if a character is moved outside of marker it stops being\n * \"special\" and the marker is shrunk. Similarly, when a character is moved into the marker from other place in document\n * model, it starts being \"special\" and the marker is enlarged.\n *\n * Another upside of markers is that finding marked part of document is fast and easy. Using attributes to mark some nodes\n * and then trying to find that part of document would require traversing whole document tree. Marker gives instant access\n * to the range which it is marking at the moment.\n *\n * Markers are built from a name and a range.\n *\n * Range of the marker is updated automatically when document changes, using\n * {@link module:engine/model/liverange~LiveRange live range} mechanism.\n *\n * Name is used to group and identify markers. Names have to be unique, but markers can be grouped by\n * using common prefixes, separated with `:`, for example: `user:john` or `search:3`. That's useful in term of creating\n * namespaces for custom elements (e.g. comments, highlights). You can use this prefixes in\n * {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~MarkerCollection#event:update} listeners to listen on changes in a group of markers.\n * For instance: `model.markers.on( 'set:user', callback );` will be called whenever any `user:*` markers changes.\n *\n * There are two types of markers.\n *\n * 1. Markers managed directly, without using operations. They are added directly by {@link module:engine/model/writer~Writer}\n * to the {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~MarkerCollection} without any additional mechanism. They can be used\n * as bookmarks or visual markers. They are great for showing results of the find, or select link when the focus is in the input.\n *\n * 1. Markers managed using operations. These markers are also stored in {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~MarkerCollection}\n * but changes in these markers is managed the same way all other changes in the model structure - using operations.\n * Therefore, they are handled in the undo stack and synchronized between clients if the collaboration plugin is enabled.\n * This type of markers is useful for solutions like spell checking or comments.\n *\n * Both type of them should be added / updated by {@link module:engine/model/writer~Writer#addMarker}\n * and removed by {@link module:engine/model/writer~Writer#removeMarker} methods.\n *\n *\t\tmodel.change( ( writer ) => {\n * \t\t\tconst marker = writer.addMarker( name, { range, usingOperation: true } );\n *\n * \t\t\t// ...\n *\n * \t\t\twriter.removeMarker( marker );\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * See {@link module:engine/model/writer~Writer} to find more examples.\n *\n * Since markers need to track change in the document, for efficiency reasons, it is best to create and keep as little\n * markers as possible and remove them as soon as they are not needed anymore.\n *\n * Markers can be downcasted and upcasted.\n *\n * Markers downcast happens on {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:addMarker} and\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:removeMarker} events.\n * Use {@link module:engine/conversion/downcast-converters downcast converters} or attach a custom converter to mentioned events.\n * For {@link module:engine/controller/datacontroller~DataController data pipeline}, marker should be downcasted to an element.\n * Then, it can be upcasted back to a marker. Again, use {@link module:engine/conversion/upcast-converters upcast converters} or\n * attach a custom converter to {@link module:engine/conversion/upcastdispatcher~UpcastDispatcher#event:element}.\n *\n * Another upside of markers is that finding marked part of document is fast and easy.

Currently, the supported modifications are:\n *\n * * Extending. The selection focus is moved in the specified `options.direction` with a step specified in `options.unit`.\n * Possible values for `unit` are:\n *  * `'character'` (default) - moves selection by one user-perceived character. In most cases this means moving by one\n *  character in `String` sense. However, unicode also defines \"combing marks\". These are special symbols, that combines\n *  with a symbol before it (\"base character\") to create one user-perceived character. For example, `q̣̇` is a normal\n *  letter `q` with two \"combining marks\": upper dot (`Ux0307`) and lower dot (`Ux0323`). For most actions, i.e. extending\n *  selection by one position, it is correct to include both \"base character\" and all of it's \"combining marks\". That is\n *  why `'character'` value is most natural and common method of modifying selection.\n *  * `'codePoint'` - moves selection by one unicode code point. In contrary to, `'character'` unit, this will insert\n *  selection between \"base character\" and \"combining mark\", because \"combining marks\" have their own unicode code points.\n *  However, for technical reasons, unicode code points with values above `UxFFFF` are represented in native `String` by\n *  two characters, called \"surrogate pairs\". Halves of \"surrogate pairs\" have a meaning only when placed next to each other.\n *  For example `𨭎` is represented in `String` by `\\uD862\\uDF4E`. Both `\\uD862` and `\\uDF4E` do not have any meaning\n *  outside the pair (are rendered as ? when alone). Position between them would be incorrect. In this case, selection\n *  extension will include whole \"surrogate pair\".\n *  * `'word'` - moves selection by a whole word.\n *\n * **Note:** if you extend a forward selection in a backward direction you will in fact shrink it.\n *\n * **Note:** Use {@link module:engine/model/model~Model#modifySelection} instead of this function.\n * This function is only exposed to be reusable in algorithms\n * which change the {@link module:engine/model/model~Model#modifySelection}\n * method's behavior.\n *\n * @param {module:engine/model/model~Model} model The model in context of which\n * the selection modification should be performed.\n * @param {module:engine/model/selection~Selection|module:engine/model/documentselection~DocumentSelection} selection\n * The selection to modify.\n * @param {Object} [options]\n * @param {'forward'|'backward'} [options.direction='forward'] The direction in which the selection should be modified.\n * @param {'character'|'codePoint'|'word'} [options.unit='character'] The unit by which selection should be modified.\n */\nexport default function modifySelection( model, selection, options = {} ) {\n\tconst schema = model.schema;\n\tconst isForward = options.direction != 'backward';\n\tconst unit = options.unit ? options.unit : 'character';\n\n\tconst focus = selection.focus;\n\n\tconst walker = new TreeWalker( {\n\t\tboundaries: getSearchRange( focus, isForward ),\n\t\tsingleCharacters: true,\n\t\tdirection: isForward ?

Currently, the supported modifications are:\n\t *\n\t * * Extending. The selection focus is moved in the specified `options.direction` with a step specified in `options.unit`.\n\t * Possible values for `unit` are:\n\t *  * `'character'` (default) - moves selection by one user-perceived character. In most cases this means moving by one\n\t *  character in `String` sense. However, unicode also defines \"combing marks\". These are special symbols, that combines\n\t *  with a symbol before it (\"base character\") to create one user-perceived character. For example, `q̣̇` is a normal\n\t *  letter `q` with two \"combining marks\": upper dot (`Ux0307`) and lower dot (`Ux0323`). For most actions, i.e. extending\n\t *  selection by one position, it is correct to include both \"base character\" and all of it's \"combining marks\". That is\n\t *  why `'character'` value is most natural and common method of modifying selection.\n\t *  * `'codePoint'` - moves selection by one unicode code point. In contrary to, `'character'` unit, this will insert\n\t *  selection between \"base character\" and \"combining mark\", because \"combining marks\" have their own unicode code points.\n\t *  However, for technical reasons, unicode code points with values above `UxFFFF` are represented in native `String` by\n\t *  two characters, called \"surrogate pairs\". Halves of \"surrogate pairs\" have a meaning only when placed next to each other.\n\t *  For example `𨭎` is represented in `String` by `\\uD862\\uDF4E`. Both `\\uD862` and `\\uDF4E` do not have any meaning\n\t *  outside the pair (are rendered as ? when alone). Position between them would be incorrect. In this case, selection\n\t *  extension will include whole \"surrogate pair\".\n\t *  * `'word'` - moves selection by a whole word.\n\t *\n\t * **Note:** if you extend a forward selection in a backward direction you will in fact shrink it.\n\t *\n\t * @fires modifySelection\n\t * @param {module:engine/model/selection~Selection|module:engine/model/documentselection~DocumentSelection} selection\n\t * The selection to modify.\n\t * @param {Object} [options]\n\t * @param {'forward'|'backward'} [options.direction='forward'] The direction in which the selection should be modified.\n\t * @param {'character'|'codePoint'|'word'} [options.unit='character'] The unit by which selection should be modified.\n\t */\n\tmodifySelection( selection, options ) {\n\t\tmodifySelection( this, selection, options );\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Gets a clone of the selected content.\n\t *\n\t * For example, for the following selection:\n\t *\n\t * ```html\n\t * <paragraph>x</paragraph>\n\t * <blockQuote>\n\t *\t<paragraph>y</paragraph>\n\t *\t<heading1>fir[st</heading1>\n\t * </blockQuote>\n\t * <paragraph>se]cond</paragraph>\n\t * <paragraph>z</paragraph>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * It will return a document fragment with such a content:\n\t *\n\t * ```html\n\t * <blockQuote>\n\t *\t<heading1>st</heading1>\n\t * </blockQuote>\n\t * <paragraph>se</paragraph>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * @fires getSelectedContent\n\t * @param {module:engine/model/selection~Selection|module:engine/model/documentselection~DocumentSelection} selection\n\t * The selection of which content will be returned.\n\t * @returns {module:engine/model/documentfragment~DocumentFragment}\n\t */\n\tgetSelectedContent( selection ) {\n\t\treturn getSelectedContent( this, selection );\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Checks whether the given {@link module:engine/model/range~Range range} or\n\t * {@link module:engine/model/element~Element element}\n\t * has any content.\n\t *\n\t * Content is any text node or element which is registered in the {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema schema}.\n\t *\n\t * @param {module:engine/model/range~Range|module:engine/model/element~Element} rangeOrElement Range or element to check.\n\t * @returns {Boolean}\n\t */\n\thasContent( rangeOrElement ) {\n\t\tif ( rangeOrElement instanceof ModelElement ) {\n\t\t\trangeOrElement = ModelRange._createIn( rangeOrElement );\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tif ( rangeOrElement.isCollapsed ) {\n\t\t\treturn false;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tfor ( const item of rangeOrElement.getItems() ) {\n\t\t\t// Remember, `TreeWalker` returns always `textProxy` nodes.\n\t\t\tif ( item.is( 'textProxy' ) || this.schema.isObject( item ) ) {\n\t\t\t\treturn true;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\n\t\treturn false;\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Creates a position from the given root and path in that root.\n\t *\n\t * Note: This method is also available as\n\t * {@link module:engine/model/writer~Writer#createPositionFromPath `Writer#createPositionFromPath()`}.\n\t *\n\t * @param {module:engine/model/element~Element|module:engine/model/documentfragment~DocumentFragment} root Root of the position.\n\t * @param {Array.<Number>} path Position path.

We take next (or first) operation from `operationsA` and check from which operation `b` we need to start transforming it.\n\t// All original `operationsA` are set to be transformed starting from the first operation `b`.\n\t//\n\t// 3. We take operations from `operationsB`, one by one, starting from the correct one, and transform operation `a`\n\t// by operation `b` (and vice versa). We update `operationsA` and `operationsB` by replacing the original operations\n\t// with the transformation results.\n\t//\n\t// 4. If operation is broken into multiple operations, we save all the new operations in the place of the\n\t// original operation.\n\t//\n\t// 5. Additionally, if operation `a` was broken, for the \"new\" operation, we remember from which operation `b` it should\n\t// be transformed by.\n\t//\n\t// 6.

Then, go to 2.\n\t// unless the last operation `a` was transformed.\n\t//\n\t// The actual implementation of the above algorithm is slightly different, as only one loop (while) is used.\n\t// The difference is that we have \"current\" `a` operation to transform and we store the index of the next `b` operation\n\t// to transform by. Each loop operates on two indexes then: index pointing to currently processed `a` operation and\n\t// index pointing to next `b` operation. Each loop is just one `a * b` + `b * a` transformation. After each loop\n\t// operation `b` index is updated. If all `b` operations were visited for the current `a` operation, we change\n\t// current `a` operation index to the next one.\n\t//\n\n\t// For each operation `a`, keeps information what is the index in `operationsB` from which the transformation should start.\n\tconst nextTransformIndex = new WeakMap();\n\n\t// For all the original `operationsA`, set that they should be transformed starting from the first of `operationsB`.\n\tfor ( const op of operationsA ) {\n\t\tnextTransformIndex.set( op, 0 );\n\t}\n\n\t// Additional data that is used for some postprocessing after the main transformation process is done.\n\tconst data = {\n\t\tnextBaseVersionA: operationsA[ operationsA.length - 1 ].baseVersion + 1,\n\t\tnextBaseVersionB: operationsB[ operationsB.length - 1 ].baseVersion + 1,\n\t\toriginalOperationsACount: operationsA.length,\n\t\toriginalOperationsBCount: operationsB.length\n\t};\n\n\tconst contextFactory = new ContextFactory( options.document, options.useRelations );\n\tcontextFactory.setOriginalOperations( operationsA );\n\tcontextFactory.setOriginalOperations( operationsB );\n\n\t// Index of currently transformed operation `a`.\n\tlet i = 0;\n\n\t// While not all `operationsA` are transformed...\n\twhile ( i < operationsA.length ) {\n\t\t// Get \"current\" operation `a`.\n\t\tconst opA = operationsA[ i ];\n\n\t\t// For the \"current\" operation `a`, get the index of the next operation `b` to transform by.\n\t\tconst indexB = nextTransformIndex.get( opA );\n\n\t\t// If operation `a` was already transformed by every operation `b`, change \"current\" operation `a` to the next one.\n\t\tif ( indexB == operationsB.length ) {\n\t\t\ti++;\n\t\t\tcontinue;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tconst opB = operationsB[ indexB ];\n\n\t\t// Transform `a` by `b` and `b` by `a`.\n\t\tconst newOpsA = transform( opA, opB, contextFactory.getContext( opA, opB, true ) );\n\t\tconst newOpsB = transform( opB, opA, contextFactory.getContext( opB, opA, false ) );\n\t\t// As a result we get one or more `newOpsA` and one or more `newOpsB` operations.\n\n\t\t// Update contextual information about operations.\n\t\tcontextFactory.updateRelation( opA, opB );\n\n\t\tcontextFactory.setOriginalOperations( newOpsA, opA );\n\t\tcontextFactory.setOriginalOperations( newOpsB, opB );\n\n\t\t// For new `a` operations, update their index of the next operation `b` to transform them by.\n\t\t//\n\t\t// This is needed even if there was only one result (`a` was not broken) because that information is used\n\t\t// at the beginning of this loop every time.\n\t\tfor ( const newOpA of newOpsA ) {\n\t\t\t// Acknowledge, that operation `b` also might be broken into multiple operations.\n\t\t\t//\n\t\t\t// This is why we raise `indexB` not just by 1.

A batch is saved instead of the operation because changes are undone batch-by-batch, not operation-by-operation\n * and a batch is seen as one undo step.\n *\n * After some changes happen to the document, the `History` and `UndoCommand` stack can be represented as follows:\n *\n *\t\t    History                            Undo stack\n *\t\t==============             ==================================\n *\t\t[operation A1]                         [batch A]\n *\t\t[operation B1]                         [batch B]\n *\t\t[operation B2]                         [batch C]\n *\t\t[operation C1]\n *\t\t[operation C2]\n *\t\t[operation B3]\n *\t\t[operation C3]\n *\n * Where operations starting with the same letter are from same batch.\n *\n * Undoing a batch means that a set of operations which will reverse the effects of that batch needs to be generated.\n * For example, if a batch added several letters, undoing the batch should remove them. It is important to apply undoing\n * operations in the reversed order, so if a batch has operation `X`, `Y`, `Z`, reversed operations `Zr`, `Yr` and `Xr`\n * need to be applied. Otherwise reversed operation `Xr` would operate on a wrong document state, because operation `X`\n * does not know that operations `Y` and `Z` happened.\n *\n * After operations from an undone batch got {@link module:engine/model/operation/operation~Operation#getReversed reversed},\n * one needs to make sure if they are ready to be applied. In the scenario above, operation `C3` is the last operation and `C3r`\n * bases on up-to-date document state, so it can be applied to the document.\n *\n *\t\t     History                             Undo stack\n *\t\t=================             ==================================\n *\t\t[ operation A1  ]                      [  batch A  ]\n *\t\t[ operation B1  ]                      [  batch B  ]\n *\t\t[ operation B2  ]             [   processing undoing batch C   ]\n *\t\t[ operation C1  ]\n *\t\t[ operation C2  ]\n *\t\t[ operation B3  ]\n *\t\t[ operation C3  ]\n *\t\t[ operation C3r ]\n *\n * Next is operation `C2`, reversed to `C2r`. `C2r` bases on `C2`, so it bases on the wrong document state. It needs to be\n * transformed by operations from history that happened after it, so it \"knows\" about them. Let us assume that `C2' = C2r * B3 * C3 * C3r`,\n * where `*` means \"transformed by\". Rest of operations from that batch are processed in the same fashion.\n *\n *\t\t     History                             Undo stack                                      Redo stack\n *\t\t=================             ==================================             ==================================\n *\t\t[ operation A1  ]                      [  batch A  ]                                    [ batch Cr ]\n *\t\t[ operation B1  ]                      [  batch B  ]\n *\t\t[ operation B2  ]\n *\t\t[ operation C1  ]\n *\t\t[ operation C2  ]\n *\t\t[ operation B3  ]\n *\t\t[ operation C3  ]\n *\t\t[ operation C3r ]\n *\t\t[ operation C2' ]\n *\t\t[ operation C1' ]\n *\n * Selective undo works on the same basis, however, instead of undoing the last batch in the undo stack, any batch can be undone.\n * The same algorithm applies: operations from a batch (i.e. `A1`) are reversed and then transformed by operations stored in history.\n *\n * Redo also is very similar to undo. It has its own stack that is filled with undoing (reversed batches).

It will clip table cells that extends beyond it section.\n * 2. It will add empty table cells to those rows which are narrower then the widest table row.\n *\n * ## Clipping overlapping table cells\n *\n * Such situation may occur when pasting a table (or part of a table) to the editor from external sources.\n *\n * For example, see the following table which has the cell (FOO) with the rowspan attribute (2):\n *\n *\t\t<table headingRows=\"1\">\n *\t\t\t<tableRow>\n *\t\t\t\t<tableCell rowspan=\"2\"><paragraph>FOO</paragraph></tableCell>\n *\t\t\t\t<tableCell colspan=\"2\"><paragraph>BAR</paragraph></tableCell>\n *\t\t\t</tableRow>\n *\t\t\t<tableRow>\n *\t\t\t\t<tableCell><paragraph>BAZ</paragraph></tableCell>\n *\t\t\t\t<tableCell><paragraph>XYZ</paragraph></tableCell>\n *\t\t\t</tableRow>\n *\t\t</table>\n *\n * will be rendered in the view as:\n *\n *\t\t<table>\n *\t\t\t<thead>\n *\t\t\t\t<tr>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td rowspan=\"2\">FOO</td>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td colspan=\"2\">BAR</td>\n *\t\t\t\t</tr>\n *\t\t\t</thead>\n *\t\t\t<tbody>\n *\t\t\t\t<tr>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td>BAZ</td>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td>XYZ</td>\n *\t\t\t\t</tr>\n *\t\t\t</tbody>\n *\t\t</table>\n *\n * In the above example the table will be rendered as a table with two rows - one in the header and second one in the body.\n * The table cell (FOO) cannot span over multiple rows as it would expand from the header to the body section.\n * The `rowspan` attribute must be changed to (1). The value (1) is a default value of the `rowspan` attribute\n * so the `rowspan` attribute will be removed from the model.\n *\n * The table cell with BAZ contents will be in the first column of the table.\n *\n * ## Adding missing table cells\n *\n * The table post-fixer will insert empty table cells to equalize table rows sizes (number of columns).\n * The size of a table row is calculated by counting column spans of table cells - both horizontal (from the same row) and\n * vertical (from rows above).\n *\n * In the above example, the table row in the body section of the table is narrower then the row from the header - it has two cells\n * with the default colspan (1). The header row has one cell with colspan (1) and second with colspan (2).\n * The table cell (FOO) does not expand beyond the head section (and as such will be fixed in the first step of this post-fixer).\n * The post-fixer will add a missing table cell to the row in the body section of the table.\n *\n * The table from the above example will be fixed and rendered to the view as below:\n *\n *\t\t<table>\n *\t\t\t<thead>\n *\t\t\t\t<tr>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td rowspan=\"2\">FOO</td>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td colspan=\"2\">BAR</td>\n *\t\t\t\t</tr>\n *\t\t\t</thead>\n *\t\t\t<tbody>\n *\t\t\t\t<tr>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td>BAZ</td>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td>XYZ</td>\n *\t\t\t\t</tr>\n *\t\t\t</tbody>\n *\t\t</table>\n *\n * ## Collaboration & Undo - Expectations vs post-fixer results\n *\n * The table post-fixer only ensures proper structure without deeper analysis of the nature of a change. As such, it might lead\n * to a structure which was not intended by the user changes. In particular, it will also fix undo steps (in conjunction with collaboration)\n * in which editor content might not return to the original state.\n *\n * This will usually happen when one or more users changes size of the table.\n *\n * As en example see a table below:\n *\n *\t\t<table>\n *\t\t\t<tbody>\n *\t\t\t\t<tr>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td>11</td>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td>12</td>\n *\t\t\t\t</tr>\n *\t\t\t\t<tr>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td>21</td>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td>22</td>\n *\t\t\t\t</tr>\n *\t\t\t</tbody>\n *\t\t</table>\n *\n * and user actions:\n *\n * 1. Both user have table with two rows and two columns.\n * 2. User A adds a column at the end of the table - this will insert empty table cells to two rows.\n * 3. User B adds a row at the end of the table- this will insert a row with two empty table cells.\n * 4. Both users will have a table as below:\n *\n *\n *\t\t<table>\n *\t\t\t<tbody>\n *\t\t\t\t<tr>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td>11</td>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td>12</td>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td>(empty, inserted by A)</td>\n *\t\t\t\t</tr>\n *\t\t\t\t<tr>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td>21</td>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td>22</td>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td>(empty, inserted by A)</td>\n *\t\t\t\t</tr>\n *\t\t\t\t<tr>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td>(empty, inserted by B)</td>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td>(empty, inserted by B)</td>\n *\t\t\t\t</tr>\n *\t\t\t</tbody>\n *\t\t</table>\n *\n * The last row is shorter then others so table post-fixer will add empty row to tha last row:\n *\n *\t\t<table>\n *\t\t\t<tbody>\n *\t\t\t\t<tr>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td>11</td>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td>12</td>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td>(empty, inserted by A)</td>\n *\t\t\t\t</tr>\n *\t\t\t\t<tr>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td>21</td>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td>22</td>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td>(empty, inserted by A)</td>\n *\t\t\t\t</tr>\n *\t\t\t\t<tr>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td>(empty, inserted by B)</td>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td>(empty, inserted by B)</td>\n *\t\t\t\t\t<td>(empty, inserted by a post-fixer)</td>\n *\t\t\t\t</tr>\n *\t\t\t</tbody>\n *\t\t</table>\n *\n * Unfortunately undo doesn't know the nature of changes and depending which user will apply post-fixer changes undoing them might lead to\n * broken table.
